Workflow for General Force Field Preparation.
This workflow is designed to streamline the creation of a general force field for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It involves the sequential execution of scripts to process atom types, generate nonbonded interaction parameters, and organize the data into a unified format. The run_workflow.sh script in atp directory is used to automate this process.
Prerequisites;
Ensure the following files are present:
ffnonbonded.itp and atomtypes.atp in their corresponding directories.
